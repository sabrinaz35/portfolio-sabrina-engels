                <p>
                    For this course, we were expected to create a digital onepager using the rotterdam style, but also an attractive interface
                    for young people interested in jazz.
                </p>
                <p>In this course I was introduced to the principle design system and we have been working on different button states. And making a user friendly attractive user interface.</p>

                <h2>Goal</h2>
                <p>The goal was to analyze and apply visual indentity in which a message is communicated in the interface. In addition, the aim was also to make the design responsive.</p>

                <h2>Proces</h2>
                <p>During the process of this interface, I took several key steps to arrive at a final design.</p>

                        <p>  
                            First, I had done some good research on what elements in the Rotterdam style design system I could start using and what could also make the interface visually appealing.</p>

                            <p>After exploring the possibilities in design, I made some sketches.
                            </p>

                        <h3>First variant hi-fi</h3>
                        <p>After I made the sketches I picked a design and worked it out.</p>
                        <p>Using a grid, I aligned everything. This was for a grid of four columns.</p>
                        <p>I had received feedback on this and the very question asked was “Is this attractive for the target audience to go to?”
                            Since I myself fell within the target audience, I actually answered no immediately.</p>
                        <p>In addition, I had based the figures on the artists of the bands that would be playing during the event.</p>
                        <p>Scroll to see the whole onepager :)</p>

                        <h3>Hi-fi version</h3>
                        <p>
                            In the end, I did maagen the basics of the first design, but tried to focus more on making it more attractive.</p>
                        <p>In doing so, we were instructed to think what kind of feeling jazz gave us and what keywords you associated with it. In my case, it was happy, colourful and chill.</p>
                        <p>Based on those key words, I started trying and pretty quickly this idea came out of that.</p>

                        <p>Finally, the intention was also to make the design responsive</p>.
