                <h2>Assignment</h2> 
                <p>
                    For the front end development course we had to try to recreate an existing website as well as possible. For which I had chosen the website of Mojo.
                </p>
                <p> All the content I have used for this comes from the site Mojo and thus has not been my own.</p>
                <p> So the point during this project was to master coding more and work more with different selectors.</p>
                <p>
                    In addition, during this course we used the screen reader and learned to understand the importance of accessibility in a website.

                <h2>Goal</h2>
                <p>The goal was to work out two different pages from neat html, css and JavaScript. With additional elaboration into a responsive design.</p>

                <h2>Proces</h2>
                <p>We focused a lot on mastering the code during this project. In doing so, we used a breakdown sketch and making assignments via codepen. </p>

                        <h3>Breakdown sketch</h3>
                        <p>For this project, we used a breakdown sketch we had to create our own of the site we wanted to recreate.</p>

                            <h3>Practise with CodePen</h3>
                            <p>We also used a lot of assignments during this project that we created through CodePen, which I found to be a useful
                                tool to use, because it makes it easy to see what certain code does when practicing coding.
                            </p>
                            <p>For example, on the right we created an animation by giving a class via JavaScript</p>

                </article>
                <p>
                    The most difficult thing I found during this project was that as soon as there is an error in the code that you sometimes take longer to find this error, but fortunately these days there are more and more tools for this that you can use for this.
